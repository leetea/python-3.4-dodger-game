python-3.4-dodger-game
======================

A simple game made with python 3.4 &amp; pygame in which the player must dodge falling enemies from the top of the screen 

My first full game made with Python 3.4 and pygame.

Note: pygame libs must be installed to play this game, and res files must be in the same folder as the script.
